# Valheim - Player Trading

# About

Tired of throwing your items to other players? This mod implements real trading between players. In order to start a new trade instance, you must first **interact** with the target player to send them a **trade request**. If the other player **accepts your trade request** (by also interacting with you), the instance will start.

During the trade instance, two windows will be visible, the first window will hold the **items you wish to offer**, the second will be a preview of the **items you will receive**. Once a player is happy with the trade they can choose to **Accept**, **both players** must have accepted before the trade can be finalized. Any changes to the trade will automatically reset both player's Accept state in order to prevent malicious behaviour.

# Features

* Quick and easy trading between players.
* Client-side only! No server installations needed.
* Works with custom items!
* Use it anywhere! As long as the player you're trading also has the mod installed.
* Full and continued gamepad support.
* Familiar keybinds will continue to work! (Splitting stacks, Quick-Select etc).

# Installation

You must have **BepinEx** installed before attempting to install this mod.
Move the **.dll file** into your **Valheim\BepInEx\plugins** folder.
